Please perform a comprehensive verification of the Muse ERP system and implement any missing features.

I need you to:

1. VERIFY ALL FEATURES - Check that every module and feature listed in LOVABLE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT.md is fully implemented and functional.

2. IDENTIFY GAPS - Create a report showing:
   ✅ Features that are complete
   ⚠️ Features that are partially implemented
   ❌ Features that are missing entirely

3. IMPLEMENT MISSING FEATURES - For any missing or incomplete features, implement them according to the specifications in LOVABLE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT.md

4. PRIORITIZE CRITICAL FEATURES - Focus on Priority 1 and 2 items first:
   - Authentication and user management
   - Manufacturing (lots, recipes, production execution)
   - Inventory tracking and transactions
   - Purchase orders and receiving
   - Sales orders and invoicing
   - Quality checks and inspections
   - Warehouse operations

5. VERIFY INTEGRATIONS - Ensure all Supabase Edge Functions are working:
   - Email functions (PO, invoice, employee welcome)
   - Xero integration functions
   - PDF extraction functions
   - User management functions

6. CHECK DATABASE SCHEMA - Verify all required tables exist with proper relationships

7. TEST KEY WORKFLOWS - Test these end-to-end:
   - Create manufacturing lot → Execute production → Complete lot
   - Create PO → Receive goods → QA inspection → Putaway
   - Create sales order → Allocate inventory → Create invoice
   - Employee clock in/out → Timesheet approval

Please start by providing a detailed status report of what exists, what's missing, and what needs to be completed. Then proceed with implementing any missing critical features.

Refer to LOVABLE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT.md for the complete feature checklist and requirements.
